## Football World Cup Score Board:
You are working on a sports data company. And we would like you to develop a new
Live Football World Cup Score Board that shows matches and scores.
The boards support the following operations:
- Start a game. When a game starts, it should capture (being initial score 0-0)
   - Home team
   - Away Team
- Finish a game. It will remove a match from the scoreboard.
- Update score. Receiving the pair score; home team score and away team score
   updates a game score
- Get a summary of games by total score. Those games with the same total score
   will be returned ordered by the most recently added to our system.
   As an example, being the current data in the system:
   - Mexico - Canada: 0 – 5
   - Spain - Brazil: 10 – 2
   - Germany - France: 2 – 2
   - Uruguay - Italy: 6 – 6
   - Argentina - Australia: 3 - 1

The summary would provide with the following information:
- Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
- Spain 10 - Brazil 2
- Mexico 0 - Canada 5
- Argentina 3 - Australia 1
- Germany 2 - France 2

## Assumptions
1. Duplicated matches with swapped home and away team are treated as the same game, for example game between POL and GER is the same as game between GER and POL.
2. Score must be a natural number greater or equal to zero.
